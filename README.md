# Data preparation and clean
Data is checked using some functins ,missing values ,duplicates and drop some cloumns that wont be used in the analysis.
first i checked the data duplicates and found 23 duplicated recored and i droped them ,then i droped the cloumns ['INCIDENT_NUMBER','OFFENSE_CODE', 'OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP', 'DISTRICT','REPORTING_AREA','SHOOTING','UCR_PART','STREET','Lat','Long','Location'] since it wont be needed in analysis based on my questions. after that i checked if there is  null value in data and there was no nulls .
